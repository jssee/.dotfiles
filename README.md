# My dotfiles
Nothing fancy. Feel free to take and use what you want. The instructions below are just for myself so I don't forget. I do not recommend running the setup on your computerâ€¦unless you're me?.

## Setup
One-liner clone and setup for new machines:
```sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsL https://dub.sh/machine)"
```

### What's happening?
The setup script simply clones this repo and unpacks its contents into `~` via rsync. Verbatim:
```sh
git clone --separate-git-dir="$HOME/.dotfiles" \
    https://github.com/jssee/.dotfiles.git tmp_dotfiles

rsync --recursive --verbose --exclude ".git" \
    --exclude "README.md" \
    --exclude "bootstrap" \
    --no-perms \
    tmp_dotfiles/ "$HOME/";

rm -r tmp_dotfiles;
```

Configuration is managed as a [bare git repo](https://marcel.is/managing-dotfiles-with-git-bare-repo/).
