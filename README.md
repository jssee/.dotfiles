# My dotfiles
Nothing fancy. Feel free to take and use what you want. The instructions below are just for myself so I don't forget. I do not recommend running the setup on your computerâ€¦unless you're me?.

## Setup
Download:
```
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jssee/.dotfiles/master/setup
```

Run:
```sh
sh setup 2>&1 | tee ~/setup.log
```

### What's happening?
The setup script simply clones this repo and unpacks its contents into `~`. Configuration is managed as a [bare git repo](https://marcel.is/managing-dotfiles-with-git-bare-repo/).
